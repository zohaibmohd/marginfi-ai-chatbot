Below is a concise, step-by-step roadmap for fixing your MarginFi aggregator stubs, based on the priority tiers you’ve outlined. The idea is to tackle the highest-impact functions first and move on to advanced features once the core is stable.

Phase 1: Core Fixes (Highest Priority)

1. getHistoricalRates
	•	Why: Historical data is crucial for analytics and user engagement.
	•	Fixes:
	•	Improve Helius parsing to handle various transaction types or instructions.
	•	Ensure timeframe logic (1d, 7d, 30d) correctly clips data at startDate and endDate.
	•	Enhance error handling for missing or malformed data, e.g. checking if resp.json() is an array, handling 404 vs. 5XX, etc.

2. getNetApy
	•	Why: Net APY is essential for user decision-making on yields and borrow costs.
	•	Fixes:
	•	Replace placeholder fee/incentive calls (fetchInsuranceFeeFromAPI, etc.) with real or mock data.
	•	Ensure your net-lending/borrowing calculations subtract or add the correct fees (protocol fees, insurance fees, incentives).
	•	Provide thorough logs or test coverage for edge cases (e.g., zero fees, negative incentives).

3. getTopBanks
	•	Why: Ranking banks is a key aggregator feature and often the first thing users look at.
	•	Fixes:
	•	Expand sorting metrics (tvl, utilization, emissions, etc.) and verify each metric is calculated properly.
	•	Confirm the rank function is robust—handle missing oracle data by skipping or returning zero.
	•	Ensure all possible metrics (like “insuranceFeeFixedApr”) produce the correct scores.

4. getBankDetail
	•	Why: A single-bank “snapshot” is extremely useful for user context.
	•	Fixes:
	•	Verify oracle price retrieval, TVL computation, utilization.
	•	Confirm that each field in the response (e.g. oraclePrice, lendingRate, borrowingRate) is accurate and updated if the aggregator logic changes.

	Estimated Timeline: ~2–3 days of focused effort to implement and test each function thoroughly.

Phase 2: Advanced Features (Medium Priority)

5. getLiquidations
	•	Why: Shows at-risk accounts or banks; helpful for advanced risk monitoring.
	•	Fixes:
	•	Integrate real-time data with Helius or a custom indexer to replace the static placeholders.
	•	Potentially fetch from MarginFi or third-party liquidation feeds if available.

6. getBestLoopingOpportunity
	•	Why: Offers advanced DeFi strategies for leveraged yield.
	•	Fixes:
	•	Use actual deposit/borrow rate calculations plus constraints like utilization, health factors.
	•	Make sure you factor in net APY logic from getNetApy to find the best yield opportunities.

7. getFilteredBanks
	•	Why: Gives users a flexible “search” or filter mechanism for banks.
	•	Fixes:
	•	Ensure the utilizationMin/utilizationMax logic is correct.
	•	Consider additional filters in the future (risk scores, custom flags, etc.).

	Estimated Timeline: ~2–4 days after core features, focusing on deeper integrations or more complex calculations.

Phase 3: Enhancements (Low Priority)

8. getTopBanksByEmissions
	•	Why: Helps yield farmers find top emission rates.
	•	Fixes:
	•	Validate how “lending” vs. “borrowing” emissions are tracked, especially if they differ by half or another ratio.

9. getVolatility
	•	Why: Adds advanced risk metrics for power users.
	•	Fixes:
	•	Replace the placeholder with real historical standard-deviation logic over time.
	•	Possibly incorporate volume or price volatility from external data.

10. getAccountBalanceSummary
	•	Why: Personalized dashboards for user accounts.
	•	Fixes:
	•	Integrate real data from MarginFi accounts.
	•	Expand to show open positions, collateral, and real-time health factor.

	Estimated Timeline: After launching your MVP or once you’re ready to polish advanced metrics.

Practical Action Steps
	1.	Pick One Function (e.g. getHistoricalRates) and fully fix:
	•	Write logs or console outputs for each step to confirm Helius data is parsed correctly.
	•	Test multiple timeframes (1d, 7d, 30d) and handle empty/no transactions.
	•	Add a basic unit or integration test if time permits.
	2.	Move On to getNetApy:
	•	Finalize how you fetch fees/incentives.
	•	Check typical APY results for a known bank or mock data.
	3.	Iterate Through Remaining Core Functions:
	•	For each aggregator function, confirm the input parameters, the logic, and the final shape of the returned data.
	•	Keep your error handling consistent (e.g., always return { error: string } on failures).
	4.	Push to Phase 2 and 3 once the core is stable.

Mantra for Refinement

	“I build with clarity and precision, step by step. Each fix brings me closer to creating something extraordinary.”

This structured approach ensures you don’t get overwhelmed. By focusing on the highest-value features first—historical rates, net APY, top banks, and bank details—your aggregator will deliver immediate utility to users while leaving advanced or polish features for later. Good luck!
